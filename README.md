### Notes
The app itself was quite easy to design! Initially, I was getting errors even though I followed the video exactly, so I had to start over twice. On the third file, the errors went away.
The biggest challenge I faced was pushing the project to github. For the prework, I had a TA do the process for me, so this time, it was much more difficult. However, I learned how to push and commit the file properly via trial and error and following the online guides.

### Open-source libraries used
